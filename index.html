I am starting a PhD in Explainable AI (granted by the Flemish AI Research program) in September 2024 in the Applied Data Mining group at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, under Professor David Martens supervision. My main focus concerns the Explainable AI methods in Graph Neural Networks, drug discovery and recommendation systems.
